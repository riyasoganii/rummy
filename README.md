# rummy
Program using PyGame library to create a GUI in which cards can be displayed and selected.

Indian version of rummy has been implemented.

I have implemented two player rummy with double deck (104 cards).

Each player gets 13 cards.

There are two jokers which can be used in place of any card to make set or sequence.

Jokers are displayed on the side of the closed deck.

You can see group function by clicking on any card in user's hand, and then clicking on some other card with ctrl key pressed.

Once you select two or more cards, Group button will become green.

If you click on Group button, the selected cards will be pulled out and displayed separately.

This enables user to display groups of cards. He can arrange his cards in sequences and sets by using this method.
